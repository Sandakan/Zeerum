			'<h1>Membrane and Mechanical Keyboards. </h1><p> To an average computer user, this may make no difference, but to someone who is around computers and uses them daily, the right type of keyboard can make all the difference in the world.While keyboards may seem like simple technology that can be written off as just an accessory to use your computer properly, they can really change how you work and how you use a computer.There are actually two types of keyboards; membrane keyboards and mechanical keyboards.</p><p>The typical keyboard that your average computer has is a membrane keyboard, which is an electro-mechanical membrane laid in a casing of a keyboard. When each key is pushed, it will trigger an electronic signal in the membrane, which is then sent along the cable of the keyboard into an input where it is then used by the keyboard. The benefits are that this is far, far cheaper to produce in a keyboard, but the cons are that the quality of a membrane keyboard is awful – if you spill water on it, it’s done, and if one part of the circuit breaks, the keyboard is done as well.</p><img src="/images/articles/0/mechanical-keyboard.jpg" alt=""><p>However, a mechanical keyboard forgoes the membrane of a keyboard in favor of a series of switches, which are connected by a central board in the keyboard. Each switch individually triggers a pulse behind sent, which has the advantage of a much more precise output but at the cost of an increased price to produce and call for increased build quality.</p><h2>Difference Between Mechanical and Membrane keyboards</h2><p>The difference in mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards is quite noticeable; while membrane keyboards typically have flat, lower profiles, mechanical keyboards are very flamboyant about their presence. Mechanical keyboards come in a variety of switches, which will create a different tactile clicking noise. This clicking noise signifies that the connection has been triggered, and a pulse will be sent to the keyboard – this is, ultimately, the most satisfying part about using a mechanical keyboard. These come in a variety of colors, all of which require a different force in order to activate, as well as a different volume of tactile sound. These switches are interchangeable, but due to the nature of individual switches, require a much larger form factor keyboard, so the keys on a mechanical keyboard stick out far more.</p><img src="/images/articles/0/membrane-keyboard.jpg" alt=""><p>Mechanical keyboards have the benefit of being a more precise typing machine, as two signals will not interfere or cancel each other out – hold down both shift keys on your own keyboard and type, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Odds are, if you are on a membrane keyboard, you missed some characters – this is due to the lack of precision in a membrane keyboard, where a mechanical keyboard will be more precise.</p><p>However, this isn’t to write off membrane keyboards entirely – some are very high quality despite being technologically limited, and are great for anyone who wants to get more into the use of a PC. For your average PC user, a membrane keyboard will suffice just fine, but for more advanced users, a higher-end membrane keyboard or even a mechanical keyboard can be necessary. I’ve recommended my top 2 picks for both membrane and mechanical keyboards, and tried to cover everyone from your basic hobbyist to your hardcore gamer and streamer.</p><h2>Logitech K120</h2><p>The most standard and vanilla model, the Logitech K120 is a membrane keyboard that does exactly what you need it to do – it types and comes with very few bells and whistles, but comes with the Logitech build quality at a low price of 2,001.63Rs ($9.99). This is a keyboard for somebody who realizes that they need a keyboard to go with a new computer, but doesn’t want to shell out a bunch of money – get this if you intend to be on your computer for 30030 minutes to an hour every day.</p><h2>Razer Blackwidow Chroma</h2><img src="/images/articles/0/razer-blackwidow-x-chroma.jpg" alt=""> <p>The ultimate finale of this list and the greatest keyboard on themarket, the Blackwidow takes after Razer’s successful design and simplicity of their previous products and combines them with the Chroma technology. Much like the Yama, the Blackwidow Chroma has individual LED lights in each key, but these lights will sync with the drivers and actually change based on your computer use – for example, the Blizzard game Overwatch causes the keyboard to flash whenever you score a lot of points. The Blackwidow Chroma is an excellent mechanical keyboard that comes with a lot of flashy features and includes constant support through the Razer Synapse app, but comes at the price tag of 32,058.14Rs ($160). However, this is a keyboard that should last you for life, and even comes with Razer’s legendary customer service where they will replace almost any part that dies from natural causes and use.</p> <p>The Blackwidow Chroma comes with numerous functions and features, including USB ports on the side, audio/voice jacks on the side, Razer Synapse support for updating the drivers and features of the keyboard, and comes with mandatory brown switches that are quiet and low-force activation.</p> ',

			'<h1>Introduction to Visual Studio Code</h1><p>Visual Studio Code is a code editor in layman’s terms. Visual Studio Code is “a free-editor that helps the programmer write code, helps in debugging and corrects the code using the intelli-sense method ”. In normal terms, it facilitates users to write the code in an easy manner. Many people say that it is half of an IDE and an editor, but the decision is up to to the coders. Any program/software that we see or use work on the code that runs in the background. Traditionally coding used to do in the traditional editors or even in the basic editors like notepad! These editors used to provide basic support to the coders.</p><p>Some of them were so basic that it was very difficult in writing basic English level programs in them. As time went by, some programming languages needed a specific framework and support for further coding and development in it, which was not possible using these editors. VI Editor, Sublime Text Editor, are one of the many kinds of editors that came into existence. The most prominent and which supports almost every coding language is VISUAL STUDIO CODE. Its features let the user modify the editor as per the usage, which means the user is able to download the libraries from the internet and integrate it with the code as per his requirements.</p><h2>What can Visual Studio Code do ?</h2><p>Visual Studio Code has some very unique features.Some are redefined to make the IDE more open and customizable for the user. Some of them are listed below. </p><ul><li><b>Support for multiple programming languages:</b> It supports multiple programming languages. So earlier, programmers needed Web-Support: a different editor for different languages, but it has built-in multi-language support. This also means it easily detects if there’s any fault or cross-language reference, it’ll be able to detect it easily.</li><li> <b>Intelli-Sense:</b> It can detect if any snippet of code is left incomplete. Also, common variable syntaxes and variable declarations are made automatically. Ex: If a certain variable is being used in the program and the user has forgotten to declare, intelli-sense will declare it for the user. </li><li><b>Cross-Platform Support:</b> Traditionally, editors used to support either Windows or Linux or Mac Systems. But Visual Studio Code is cross-platform. So it can work on all three platforms. Also, the code works on all three platforms; else, the open-source and proprietary software codes used to be different.</li><li><b>Extensions and Support:</b> Usually supports all the programming languages but, if the user/programmer wants to use the programming language which is not supported then, he can download the extension and use it. And performance-wise, the extension doesn’t slow down the editor as it rums as a different process.</li><li><b>Repository:</b> With the ever-increasing demand for the code, secure and timely storage is equally important. It is connected with Git or can be connected with any other repository for pulling or saving the instances.</li><li><b>Web-Support:</b> Comes with built-in support for Web applications. So web-applications can be built and supported in VSC.</li><li><b>Hierarchy Structure:</b> The code files are located in files and folders. The required code files also have some files, which may be required for other complex projects. These files can be deleted as per convenience.</li><li><b>Improving Code:</b> Some code snippets can be declared a bit differently, which might help the user in the code. This function prompts the user, wherever necessary, to change it to the suggested option.</li><li><b>Terminal Support:</b> Many of the times, the user needs to start from the root of the directory to start with a particular action, in-built terminal or console provides user support to not to switch in-between two screens for thesame.</li><li><b>Multi-Projects:</b> Multiple projects containing multiple files/folders can be opened simultaneously. These projects/folders might or might not be related to each other.</li><li><b>Git Support:</b> Resources can be pulled from Git Hub Repo online and vice-versa; saving can be done too. Resource pulling also means to clone the code which is made available on the internet. This code can later be changed and saved.</li><li><b>Commenting:</b> A common feature, but some of the languages do not support it. Commenting on the code helps the user to recall or track according to the sequence he wants.</li></ul><img src="/images/articles/1/visual-studio-code-1.jpg" alt="" /><h2>Advantages and why we should use Visual Studio Code</h2><p>When compared to others, there are unique advantages in using Visual Studio Code. Some of them are listed below:</p><ol><li>Cross platform support:</li><li>Light-weight</li><li>Robust architecture</li><li>Intelli-Sense</li><li>Free and open source: Probably the best feature for all the programmers out there,even more for the organizations.</li><li>Many users will use it or might have used it for desktop applications only. But it also provides great tools and support for web technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, JSON etc.</li></ol><p>There are a few things that one can find a bit odd compared with so many features. It mainly helps the front-end developers as compared with the back-end developers. But as per some user’s opinions, it is equally helpful. It supports most of the languages used by most of the programmers, but other languages might have to download, or extensions may have to be used for them. Along with this common zoom-in, zoom-out brightness, theme selection features too are made available.</p><h2>Visual Studio Scope</h2><p>Visual Studio Code provides seemless support for many languages including most commonly used languages and some of them are given below:</p><ul><li>Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.</li><li>Server-side technologies like JSON, PHP, NodeJS, etc.</li><li>Programming languages like Python, Java, C, C# etc.</li><li>Database managing technologies like SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.</li></ul><img src="/images/articles/1/programming-languages.jpg" alt="" /><h2>Why do you need Visual Studio Code</h2><p>Till recent times, there’s hardly been an IDE or code editor that has been so user-friendly that even first time users can use each and every feature without any hassles. The coding-friendly feature and code error recognition also helps users a long way into making the code more efficient and error-less.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With advancements in technology day-by-day, Visual Studio Code is going to play a pivotal role in the development of softwares. With its ever-evolving features and soon-to-be-added new settings, which will enable users to work with it from anywhere, it is certainly “THE THING” to keep one ahead of everyone in this ever-increasing IT market.</p>',

			'<p>When Jack McMullen goes to the gym to work on his shot, he won’t let himself leave until he hits 10 3-pointers in a row. Monday, he came close to doing it in a game. McMullen was beyond hot against Rogers, hitting 13 of 15 3-pointers in a 54-point night to lead the East Greenwich boys basketball team to a 73-50 win over the Vikings. “It was just like a Larry Bird/Steph Curry type of night,” EG coach Don Bowen said. “The kids on the bench were like ‘are you kidding me?’ He was just in a zone.” “My whole life, shooting with my dad, you hit four in a row from three and the next one is usually back rim or one is off,” McMullen said. “I was waiting for the back rim to happen but they just kept going in. This is the biggest groove I’ve ever had in my life.” McMullen’s 54 points beat the former record of 51 set by Dave Canning in 1996. It’s the most points scored by a high school player since Erickson Bans scored 57 in a playoff game against Tolman on Feb 26, 2019.</p><p>The 13 3-pointers is an East Greenwich and almost doubled McMullen’s personal best of seven I a single high school game. Where it stands among state records is uncertain; Bans hit 11 in that playoff game against Tolman and Steve DeMeo, his coach, said that was his career high. <b>Henry Coleman</b>, the Mount St. Charles boys basketball coach who serves as the state’s unofficial high school basketball historian, couldn’t remember anyone hitting more than 10 prior to Bans. Whether or not it’s a state record doesn’t matter much to McMullen.</p><img src="/images/articles/2/images.jpg" alt=""><span> “Right now it’s so surreal,” McMullen said. “I worked really hard with my dad in the gym and having the results show, some al-time results maybe, it’s just really cool.</span><span>“I’m really happy and proud of the work my dad and I put in.”</span><span>McMullen scored 10 points in the first quarter, hitting two 3-pointers. He followed it with a 17-point second quarter, hitting four 3-pointers.</span>',
